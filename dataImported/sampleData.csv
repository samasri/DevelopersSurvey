WordPatternBaseline,29599005,29620460,0,0,UPDATE : cw protocol introduce in Swift 4 should be sufficient for most of the CW parsing case .,

condinsight,29965764,29966016,1,0,then if you need you can also create a list in this way :,
WordPatternBaseline,29965764,29966016,2,0,P.S. you json string should be look like this :,
condinsight,29571284,29574160,0,2,"For instance , you have to define if parameters in a JSON body are equivalent to querystring parameters or something else entirely .",
condinsight,29571284,29574160,3,2,"So , if a client has a broken implementation , it can write the CW request as a CW , sending the CW method , and you can have a middleware that 's decoupled from your application implementation and rewrites the method accordingly .",
